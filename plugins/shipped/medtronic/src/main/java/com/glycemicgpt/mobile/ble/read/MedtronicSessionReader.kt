 * incremental inverse of [PduFramer.fragment] for any payload whose length is not an exact multiple
 * of [maxPduSize].
 *
 * The exact-multiple ambiguity (a frame that fragments into all-full PDUs has no short terminator)
 * does not arise for the small SAKE-encrypted CGM records this story handles; record-level,

 * **Timeout contract:** this framework carries no timers so it stays transport-agnostic and

 * guideline ("all BLE operations must have timeouts"), the on-device caller (the C3
 * `BluetoothGatt`-client wiring) **must** bound every exchange with an operation timeout and surface
 * expiry as a [MedtronicReadException] -- e.g. by wrapping these calls in a coroutine with
 * `withTimeout`. The pure logic here is the request/decrypt/reassemble/terminate choreography only.
