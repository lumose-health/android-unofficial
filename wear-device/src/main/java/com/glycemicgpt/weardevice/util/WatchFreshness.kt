// MIRROR: tier bounds must stay in sync with the phone's
// app/src/main/java/com/glycemicgpt/mobile/domain/freshness/Freshness.kt (FreshnessPolicy.CGM /
// FreshnessPolicy.PUMP). The wear module deliberately has no dependency on the phone app, so the
// values are mirrored here the same way WearDataContract is; a drift would make the watch call
// the same reading fresher or staler than the phone does.
//
// GLY-116 axis (b): every wrist surface that shows a pushed value (BG, IoB, the last alert)
// ages it against the WATCH's own clock with these tiers, independently of the mirrored
// "watching" status — a dead phone freezes pushes, and only local aging turns that frozen
// snapshot into an honest "no recent data".
