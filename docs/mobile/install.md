title: Install the Android App
description: Step-by-step Android install for the GlycemicGPT companion app.
---

The Android companion app is **required** to connect your insulin pump over Bluetooth. The platform alone cannot read pump data via Bluetooth -- the phone app handles that.

This guide covers installing the app on your phone. It assumes you've already got the platform running (see [Get Started](../get-started.md) if not).

> **Before you start, you need:**
>
> - An Android phone running **Android 11 or newer**
> - Bluetooth support (essentially every phone made in the past decade)
> - The platform already running and reachable -- either at `http://<your-computer-ip>:3000` (local) or `https://yourdomain.com` (always-on deployment). If you don't know your computer's IP, see the box below.
> - The platform URL written down -- you'll paste it into the app

> **iOS / iPhone:** Today only Android is supported. iOS is on the roadmap (see [ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/GlycemicGPT/GlycemicGPT/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)) but not available yet. If you only have an iPhone, you can still use the dashboard in your phone's browser -- you just won't get live pump data without an Android phone for the companion app.

> **How to find your computer's IP address (for "trying it locally"):**
>
> - **macOS:** Apple menu → System Settings → Network → click your active connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) → look for "IP Address."
> - **Windows:** Settings → Network & Internet → click your connection → look for "IPv4 address."
> - **Linux (Ubuntu / Fedora / etc.):** open a terminal and run `ip addr show` -- look for the `inet` line under your active network adapter (usually `wlan0` for Wi-Fi or `eth0`/`enp...` for Ethernet).
>
> The IP usually starts with `192.168.` or `10.0.` -- something like `192.168.1.42`. Your platform URL will then be `http://192.168.1.42:3000`.

> **For the local path, your phone must be on the same Wi-Fi as the computer running the platform.** The "trying it locally" mode only works on your home network -- if you want to use the dashboard from work, the grocery store, etc., you need an [always-on deployment](../get-started.md#choose-your-path).

## Step 1: Download the APK

GlycemicGPT ships its Android app as a signed APK on GitHub Releases.

1. Open [github.com/GlycemicGPT/glycemicgpt-android-unofficial/releases](https://github.com/GlycemicGPT/glycemicgpt-android-unofficial/releases) on your phone (or a computer)
2. Find the **latest stable release** -- the topmost entry on the page *without* a yellow "Pre-release" label. (GitHub uses the "Pre-release" label for in-progress builds that haven't been promoted to stable yet.)
3. Under **Assets**, download `app-release.apk`

If you'd rather get the latest development build (newer features, less tested), use the [`dev-latest` pre-release](https://github.com/GlycemicGPT/glycemicgpt-android-unofficial/releases/tag/dev-latest) and download `app-debug.apk` instead.

> **Stable vs dev:** If you're new to GlycemicGPT, use the stable release. The dev build is what the project lead runs daily, but it's where new bugs surface first.

## Step 2: Install the APK

Android blocks installs of APKs not from the Play Store by default. You'll need to allow it for the file manager / browser you used to download the APK -- a one-time permission.

### Path A: Install directly on your phone (most common)

1. On your phone, open the file manager (or your browser's downloads list) and tap `app-release.apk`
2. Android will show: *"For your security, your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source."* Tap **Settings**.
3. Toggle **Allow from this source** to ON. Go back.
4. Tap **Install**.
5. After installation, tap **Open**.

### Path B: Sideload via ADB (if Path A doesn't work)

Some phones, work-managed devices, or devices in restrictive corporate / family settings block APK installs entirely from the file manager. In that case, you can install over USB or wireless ADB from a computer.

> **Heads up:** This path requires using your computer's terminal -- the same text-based command interface used in [Get Started](../get-started.md#a-note-on-the-terminal). If you're not comfortable with the terminal, ask someone who is, or skip Path B and use Path A instead. Path A (tap the APK on your phone) works for the vast majority of users.

What you'll need:

- A computer with **Android Platform Tools** installed -- this is what gives you the `adb` command. Install with:
  - **macOS:** `brew install android-platform-tools` (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh))
  - **Linux:** `sudo apt install android-tools-adb` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `sudo dnf install android-tools` (Fedora)
  - **Windows:** download the [Platform Tools zip](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools), unzip, and add the folder to your PATH (or just run `adb.exe` from the unzipped folder)
- A USB cable, OR wireless ADB enabled on the phone (Wi-Fi networking only)
- Developer Options enabled on the phone -- this is a one-time setting:
  1. On your phone, open **Settings → About phone**
  2. Tap **Build number** seven times in quick succession. The phone will say "You are now a developer."
- USB debugging enabled (Settings → Developer Options → USB debugging)

Once you have all that, plug your phone into your computer with the USB cable. Open a terminal on your computer (see [the terminal note in Get Started](../get-started.md#a-note-on-the-terminal) if you're new to it), navigate to the folder where you downloaded `app-release.apk`, then run:

```bash
adb install app-release.apk
```

What this does: `adb` (Android Debug Bridge) sends the APK file to the phone over USB and triggers an install. The phone might show a "USB debugging authorization" prompt the first time you do this -- accept it, and check "Always allow from this computer" so you don't get prompted again.

If you see `Performing Streamed Install ... Success`, the app is installed -- find it in your phone's app drawer and open it.

If you see `INSTALL_FAILED_USER_RESTRICTED`, your phone has installs from sources other than the Play Store blocked at the policy level -- common on work-managed devices. Talk to your IT admin or use a personal device.

## Step 3: Open the app

Find **GlycemicGPT** in your app drawer and tap to open.

The first launch shows an onboarding flow:

1. **Server URL** -- paste your platform's address. Examples:
   - Trying it locally with the platform on the same network: `http://192.168.1.50:3000` (replace with your computer's local IP -- find it in System Settings → Network)
   - Always-on deployment: `https://glycemicgpt.yourdomain.com`
2. **Sign in** -- use the email and password you registered in step 7 of [Get Started](../get-started.md).

If the app says it can't connect, your phone can't reach the platform. Common causes:
- Trying it locally but your phone is on a different Wi-Fi network than the platform
- A firewall on your computer blocking inbound connections to port 3000
- The platform's `CORS_ORIGINS` doesn't include the URL you typed -- check `.env` and restart the API service if you change it

## Step 4: Pair your pump

This is the part the platform alone cannot do.

1. Once signed in, the app shows a dashboard. If no pump is paired, you'll see a "Pair pump" prompt.
2. Tap **Pair pump**. The app asks for permission to use Bluetooth and Location (Android requires Location for Bluetooth scanning -- this is an OS quirk; the app does not track your location).
3. Put your pump in pairing mode (consult your pump's manual -- on Tandem t:slim X2, this is **Options → Bluetooth Settings → Pair Device**).
4. The app discovers your pump and asks for the 6-digit pairing code shown on the pump's screen. Enter it.
5. The app and pump exchange pairing keys. This takes a few seconds.

Once paired, the app stays connected to the pump in the background and forwards live data (insulin on board, basal rate, glucose, battery, reservoir) to your platform.

The row of icons at the top of the app's home screen tells you at a glance whether the pump is connected, whether your data is syncing, and which integrations are active -- see [The App Status Icons](./status-icons.md) for what each one means.

## Step 5: Confirm data is flowing

Open your dashboard at the platform's URL. You should see:

- A glucose chart populating with recent readings
- Insulin on Board (IoB) updating
- Basal rate and reservoir level under the pump status

If the dashboard is still empty after 5 minutes, see [Troubleshooting -- BG isn't updating](../troubleshooting/bg-not-updating.md).

## Updating the app

When a new GlycemicGPT release ships, you'll see a stale-version banner in the app. To update:

1. Download the new `app-release.apk` from the latest release on GitHub
2. Open it on your phone -- Android handles it as an "in-place upgrade"
3. The app reopens with the new version; your settings, login, and pump pairing are preserved

The app does not auto-update -- there's no Play Store distribution today. F-Droid and Play Store distribution are on the roadmap.

## A few notes

- **Battery and Bluetooth:** the app stays connected to your pump in the background, which uses some battery. On most phones the impact is small (< 5% per day) because Tandem's Bluetooth protocol is energy-efficient. If you see your phone disconnecting from the pump frequently, your phone's battery optimization may be killing the app -- exempt GlycemicGPT in Settings → Battery → Battery optimization.
- **No insulin delivery:** the app is read-only. It does not deliver bolus, change basal rates, or modify any pump setting. See [What This Software Is and Isn't](../concepts/what-this-software-is-and-isnt.md) for the project's monitoring-only stance.
- **Single device pairing:** Tandem pumps allow only one Bluetooth connection at a time. If your pump is already paired with another app (the official t:connect app, for example), unpair it first -- only one phone can be connected.
