/**
 * The one observation pipeline behind the honest alerting surface (GLY-115 AC7). The pure
 * decision lives in [alertFloorStatus]; this class owns WHICH inputs feed it and on WHAT
 * cadence — exactly the parts the in-app banner ([com.glycemicgpt.mobile.presentation.alerts.AlertsViewModel])
 * and the backgrounded foreground-notification text ([PumpConnectionService]) must never
 * disagree on, which is why there is a single shared provider instead of two pipelines.
 *
 * Recomputes on every input change plus a ticker, because the decisive input — the latest CGM
 * reading's age — grows with no new emissions: the "watching" claim must decay to "NOT watching"
 * on its own when readings stop. Tick cadence derives from the active freshness policy the same
 * way FreshnessUi's does, so the compressed debug policy flips within seconds during E2E.
