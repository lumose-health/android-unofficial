/**
 * The on-device, freshness-gated alert floor (GLY-115): when the backend cannot deliver alerts,
 * the phone itself fires a low/high OS alarm off the just-polled CGM reading — but ONLY on a
 * genuinely FRESH reading. Threshold-only by design: no trajectory projection, no prediction
 * horizons, no IoB escalation — those stay server-side.
 *
 * THE SAFETY INVARIANT: never fire on a non-FRESH reading. Alerting on stale cached CGM would be
 * a silent floor — the user hears an alarm engine that is actually reasoning about old data, or
 * worse, hears nothing and believes they are covered. When this class cannot vouch for the data,
 * it stays silent and the degraded surface says "NOT watching"
 * ([com.glycemicgpt.mobile.presentation.alerts.alertFloorStatus] mirrors these gates exactly).
 *
 * Four preconditions, ALL required before firing:
 *  1. Server alerting degraded — [isAlertingDegraded]; while REACHABLE+CONNECTED the server owns
 *     alerting and the floor is silent (primary dedup layer).
 *  2. Reading FRESH — [isFreshForAlertFloor] against the CGM's own sensor timestamp (never poll
 *     wall-clock), with the clock-skew guard, using the debug-swapped policy when the
 *     fast-staleness fault toggle is on.
 *  3. Thresholds configured — [AlertThresholdStore.isConfigured], from either a backend sync
 *     or the local Settings editor (GLY-145); never alarm off hardcoded defaults.
 *  4. POST_NOTIFICATIONS granted — checked here (and again inside
 *     [AlertNotificationManager.showAlertNotification]).
 *
 * Dedup against the server (no shared UUIDs — the phone cannot predict server alert IDs):
 * gate 1 kills the double-fire at the source; the shared
 * [AlertNotificationManager.stableNotificationId] slot (`alertType|patientName`) makes a server
 * re-delivery on reconnect REPLACE the floor notification instead of stacking; a per-type
 * cooldown mirroring the server's 30-minute dedup window stops a sustained low from re-alarming
 * every poll; and the episode guard seeds that cooldown from Room's server-alert history so the
 * floor does not re-alarm a low the server already announced just before the connection dropped.
 *
 * Like the server's dedup, the suppression window is ACK-GATED: the backend only dedups against
 * unacknowledged alerts, so the episode guard ignores acknowledged server alerts. A "Got It" on
 * a floor alert ([onFloorAlertAcknowledged]) means "seen", with bounded-snooze episode
 * semantics: the ongoing episode is silenced and the cooldown restarts from the ack; any
 * evaluated reading that no longer classifies as the acked type fully re-arms it (a re-cross is
 * a distinct episode and alarms immediately); and a sustained, never-recovering low re-alarms
 * [FLOOR_COOLDOWN_MS] after the ack — the floor never goes permanently silent on an ongoing
 * emergency. (Deliberate divergence from the server, which re-alerts an acked sustained low on
 * its own evaluation cadence: re-alarming every 15s poll would be alarm-spam that trains users
 * to disable notifications.)
 *
 * Wall-clock rewind guard: [isFreshForAlertFloor] can only defend forward skew statelessly. A
 * BACKWARD wall-clock jump (NTP correction, manual change) shrinks a stale reading's apparent
 * age, so this class keeps a high-water mark of every wall-clock time it has observed
 * ([noteWallClock], also fed by [AlertFloorStatusProvider]'s tick) and refuses to evaluate — and
 * the surface refuses to claim watching — while `now` runs more than the skew tolerance behind
 * it ([isWallClockRewound]). Fails closed with the honest "NOT watching" surface until the wall
 * clock catches back up. Residual: a rewind while the process is not running leaves no water
 * mark, so a stale reading can under-age by the rewind amount — a rare over-alarm edge that
 * fails toward alarming, never toward silence.
 *
 * Fires in the server's AlertType vocabulary ([AlertTypes], matching the backend's
 * `models/alert.py`), NOT the watch relay's strings — the notification slot and channel routing
 * key off the server vocabulary, and mixing them would break both.
