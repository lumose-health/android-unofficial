 * precondition so the one user-fixable cause (notification permission) is not hidden behind a
 * false "no recent glucose" diagnosis. [AlertFloorStatus.ServerActive] has no banner, returns null.
 *
 * [backendConfigured] selects between the two copy modes (GLY-145): with a backend the copy may
 * reference the server and its restored connection; in BLE-only mode no string may imply a
 * server ever existed — the phone's floor is the only alerting there is.
